bannedWords.txt was adapted from https://github.com/coffee-and-fun/google-profanity-words

This list is used to avoid generating shortcodes that contain profanity.

Modifications:

* Only includes profanity that contains alphabetical characters (our shortcodes do not contain any other characters)
* Only includes profanity that is 6 characters or fewer (our shortcodes are 6 characters long)
